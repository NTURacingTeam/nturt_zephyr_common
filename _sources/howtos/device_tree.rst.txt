How to Write Devicetree Files in Zephyr
=======================================

Scope
=====

This document provides a guide on how to write  ``.dts`` and ``.overlay`` files,
particularly targeting STM32 microcontrollers.

Prerequisites
=============

Generally, you should read through all the guides in the `Devicetree Guide
<https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/index.html#devicetree-guide>`_
to be familiar with the basics of devicetree files in Zephyr. Amoung them, the
flowing guides are particularly useful:

* `Syntex and structure of devicetree files
  <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/4.0.0/build/dts/intro-syntax-structure.html>`_
* `Relationship between devicetree files and devicetree bindings
  <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/4.0.0/build/dts/bindings-intro.html>`_
* `Using phandles <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/4.0.0/build/dts/phandles.html>`_
