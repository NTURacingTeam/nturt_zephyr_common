properties:
  poll-period:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      How often to get new sensor samples for the various axes in milliseconds.

child-binding:
  description: |
    Each axis this device controls.

  properties:
    zephyr,axis:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The input code that this axis will produce, typically any of
        INPUT_ABS_*.
    out-min:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        Minimum value to output on input events.
    out-max:
      type: int
      default: 255
      description: |
        Maximum value to output on input events.
    deadzone-mode:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        The mode of deadzone. Can be either INPUT_DEADZONE_MODE_CENTER or
        INPUT_DEADZONE_MODE_EDGE. If CENTER is specified, sensor value within
        the center plus or minus the deadzone size will be reported as center.
        If EDGE is specified, sensor value within the minimum value plus the
        deadzone size will be reported as the minimum value.
      enum:
        - 0
        - 1
    deadzone-size:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        Deadzone size of the sensor in percentage. Set to 0 to disable deadzone.
        Note that if both noise and deadzone are enabled, the deadzone should be
        greater than noise.
    noise:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        Change in sensor value before a new value is reported in one-millionth
        part. Set to 0 to disable noise filter.
        Note that if both noise and deadzone are enabled, the deadzone should be
        greater than noise.
    dev-tolerance:
      type: int
      default: 100
      description: |
        The tolerance of value deviation between any two sensors used in this
        axis in percentage. Set to 100 to disable deviation check.

  child-binding:
    description: |
      Each sensor this axis combines into.
    properties:
      sensor:
        type: phandle
        required: true
        description: |
          The sensor to fetch data from.
      zephyr,channel:
        type: int
        required: true
        description: |
          The channel of the sensor to fetch data from.
      in-min:
        type: array
        required: true
        description: |
          Minimum value from the sensor that corresponds to minimum output
          value.
          The format is the same as struct sensor_value in <X Y>, where X is the
          integer part and Y is the one-
          millionth part.
      in-max:
        type: array
        required: true
        description: |
          Maximum value from the sensor that corresponds to maximum output
          value.
          The format is the same as struct sensor_value in <X Y>, where X is the
          integer part and Y is the one-
          millionth part.
      range-tolerance:
        type: int
        default: 0
        description: |
          Sensor value tolerance to go below minimum or above maximum before
          it's considered out of range in percentage.
      weight:
        type: int
        default: 1
        description: |
          The weight of this sensor channel in the final output.
