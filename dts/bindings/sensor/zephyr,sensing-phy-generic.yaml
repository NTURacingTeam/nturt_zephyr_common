  Generic physical sensor for sensing subsystem.

compatible: "zephyr,sensing-phy-generic"

include: zephyr,sensing-phy-sensor.yaml

properties:
  fake-interval:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Sensing subsystem uses SENSOR_ATTR_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY to set interval. If
      the underlying sensor does not support this attribute, this property can
      be set to true to fake the interval and prevent errors.
  fake-sensitivity:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Sesning subsystem uses SENSOR_ATTR_HYSTERESIS to set sensitivity. If the
      underlying sensor does not support this attribute, this property can be
      set to true to fake the sensitivity and prevent errors.
