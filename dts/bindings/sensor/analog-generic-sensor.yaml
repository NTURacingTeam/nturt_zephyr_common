  Generic analog sensor. Linearly interpolates voltage to sensor value. Clamps
  the value for voltages within tolerance range or returns error if voltage is
  out of range.

compatible: "analog-generic-sensor"

include: sensor-device.yaml

properties:
  io-channels:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The ADC channel connected to the sensor.
  zephyr,channel:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Sensor channel of this device.
  min-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Minimum voltage range in millivolts.
  max-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum voltage range in millivolts.
  min-value:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Reported sensor value when min-voltage is read. The format is the same as
      sensor_value in <X Y>, where X is the integer part and Y is the one-
      millionth part.
  max-value:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Reported sensor value when max-voltage is read. The format is the same as
      struct sensor_value in <X Y>, where X is the integer part and Y is the
      one-millionth part.
  tolerance:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Voltage tolerance to go below minimum or above maximum before it's
      considered out of range in percentage.
